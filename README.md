# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionalities 

This project utilised the https://www.themealdb.com/ APIs to showcase different recipes. Which also saves user's search history when searching for meals in the search bar.

### Authentication

This website also used firebase to establish user sign up, log in and search history. Allowing users to regiser using email or gmail and using firestore to store each user's search history.

Please do remember to have your own .env file for firebase configurations as this will not work without firebase API.
